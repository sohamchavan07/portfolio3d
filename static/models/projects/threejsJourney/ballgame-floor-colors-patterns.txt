QUICK CREATION STEPS:
=====================

1. **Create new document** with dimensions matching current floorTexture.webp
2. **Fill background** with dark gray (#2a2a2a)
3. **Add pattern layer** with one of the options above
4. **Set pattern opacity** to 15-20%
5. **Test seamless tiling** using Offset filter
6. **Export as WebP** with good compression

**Photoshop/GIMP Steps:**
- Create pattern layer
- Use "Offset" filter (Filter > Other > Offset)
- Check for seamless edges
- Adjust if needed
- Export as WebP

**Recommended Pattern:**
- Hexagonal grid with #ff6b35 orange at 15% opacity
- Base color: #2a2a2a dark gray
- Pattern size: Small enough to not interfere with 3D objects

**File Requirements:**
- Format: WebP
- Resolution: Match existing floorTexture.webp
- File size: Under 300KB
- Seamless tiling: Essential for 3D rendering
