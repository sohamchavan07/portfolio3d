BALLGAME FLOOR TEXTURE SPECIFICATIONS
=====================================

This file describes the requirements for creating a new floor texture that will work
well for 3D rendering and complement your "BALL REFLECTOR JOURNEY" ballgame project.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR 3D FLOOR TEXTURES:
=============================================

1. **SEAMLESS REPETITION:**
   - The texture must tile seamlessly (edges should connect perfectly)
   - No visible seams when applied to 3D surfaces
   - Pattern should flow naturally across the entire floor

2. **RESOLUTION & FORMAT:**
   - Format: WebP (to match current file)
   - Resolution: Match existing floorTexture.webp dimensions
   - File size: Optimized for web (under 300KB)
   - Quality: High enough for close-up viewing

3. **3D RENDERING COMPATIBILITY:**
   - Subtle enough not to interfere with 3D objects
   - Good contrast for visibility without being distracting
   - Works well with lighting and shadows

DESIGN THEMES FOR BALLGAME PROJECT:
===================================

**Option 1: ARCADE-STYLE PATTERN**
- Subtle grid or hexagonal pattern
- Colors: Dark gray/black base with subtle orange accents
- Style: Gaming/arcade aesthetic
- Pattern: Small, repeating geometric shapes

**Option 2: BALL PHYSICS THEME**
- Subtle circular or spherical patterns
- Colors: Dark background with light gray/white circles
- Style: Represents the ball mechanics of your game
- Pattern: Small, scattered circles or dots

**Option 3: MODERN TECH PATTERN**
- Abstract geometric or circuit-like patterns
- Colors: Dark base with subtle blue/cyan accents
- Style: Modern, technological aesthetic
- Pattern: Lines, angles, or circuit elements

**Option 4: MINIMAL SUBTLE TEXTURE**
- Very subtle noise or grain pattern
- Colors: Dark gray/black with minimal variation
- Style: Clean, professional, understated
- Pattern: Subtle noise or texture variation

RECOMMENDED DESIGN APPROACH:
============================

**Primary Choice: Option 1 (Arcade-Style Pattern)**
- Fits the "BALL REFLECTOR JOURNEY" arcade theme
- Subtle enough for 3D rendering
- Professional appearance
- Complements your portfolio aesthetic

**Design Elements:**
- Base: Dark gray (#2a2a2a) or black (#000000)
- Accent: Subtle orange (#ff6b35) at 10-15% opacity
- Pattern: Small hexagonal or grid pattern
- Scale: Pattern should be small enough to not interfere with 3D objects

**Alternative: Option 4 (Minimal Subtle Texture)**
- If you prefer a more understated look
- Dark base with very subtle texture variation
- Professional and clean appearance
- Won't compete with your project content

CREATION GUIDELINES:
====================

1. **Start with a dark base** (dark gray or black)
2. **Add subtle pattern** at low opacity
3. **Test for seamless tiling** before finalizing
4. **Ensure good contrast** for visibility
5. **Keep it subtle** - it should enhance, not dominate

**Software Recommendations:**
- Photoshop, GIMP, or similar image editing software
- Use "Offset" filter to test seamless tiling
- Export as WebP with good compression

**Testing:**
- Apply to a flat surface in your 3D software
- Check for visible seams or repetition artifacts
- Ensure it looks good from different camera angles
